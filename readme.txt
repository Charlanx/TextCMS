How to use TextCMS
--------------------
Your posts must be text files in the root directory of this folder with the post titles as the files' names.
For each new post, make an entry of the post's file name in the metadata.json file, each on a new line in the order you wish the posts to be displayed.
Use style.css in the root directory to style each post. Each post comes with classes called "post_title" and "post_content" for the title and content respectively.
Happy blogging!
